```

#### openSUSE

Via package manager:

```
sudo zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/games/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/ games
sudo zypper ref
sudo zypper in no-more-secrets
```

From source:
```
sudo zypper ref
sudo zypper in ncurses-devel
git clone https://github.com/bartobri/no-more-secrets.git
cd ./no-more-secrets
make
sudo make install
```

#### Mac OSX

Install the Homebrew package manager by following the instructions on the website: http://brew.sh/

Once Homebrew is installed, you can install no-more-secrets:

```
brew install no-more-secrets
```

#### Docker Container

Run 

```
docker build -t bartobri/no-more-secrets .
```
to build the container.

Run with
```
ls -l | docker run --rm -i -e TERM=$TERM bartobri/no-more-secrets 
```


#### Generic Instructions

First, make sure you have the ncurses header installed:
```
ls /usr/include | grep ncurses.h
```
Also make sure you have the ncurses library for wide character support:
```
ls /usr/lib | grep libncursesw.so
```
If either file is missing, you may need to install the ncurses and/or ncursesw library. All linux
distributions should have these available from their package manager. Usually they are both included
in a single package named something along the lines of 'ncurses'. However, on some distrubutions, such
as Ubuntu, you need to install them as separate packages. For example:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lib32ncurses5-dev lib32ncursesw5-dev
```
Use your package manager to search for the "ncurses" package. Install
it. If you see two different packages for "ncurses" and "ncursesw", install them both (as shown above
in the Ubuntu example).

Next, download and build the standalone executable:
```
git clone https://github.com/bartobri/no-more-secrets.git
cd ./no-more-secrets
make
sudo make install
```
